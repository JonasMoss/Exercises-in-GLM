\section*{Additional Exercise 27}

\subsection*{(a)}
We have done this one many times.

\subsection*{(b)}
We have done this one many times.

\subsection*{(c)}
The score function is
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\frac{d}{d\beta_{0}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\log f(y_{i})\\
\frac{d}{d\beta_{1}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\log f(y_{i})
\end{array}\right) & = & \left(\begin{array}{c}
\frac{d}{d\beta_{0}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[-(\exp[\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i}])+y_{i}(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i})\right]\\
\frac{d}{d\beta_{1}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[-(\exp[\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i}])+y_{i}(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i})\right]
\end{array}\right),\\
 & = & \left(\begin{array}{c}
\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[-\exp[\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i}]+y_{i}\right]\\
\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[-x_{i}\exp[\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i}]+x_{i}y_{i}\right]
\end{array}\right),\\
 & = & \left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\
x_{i}
\end{array}\right)\left(y_{i}-\mu_{i}\right),
\end{eqnarray*}
since $\mu_{i}=\exp[\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i}]$.
The information matrix is the negative expected matrix of second derivatives
of the log-likelihood. Each observation contributes
\[
I_{i}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\mu_{i} & x_{i}\mu_{i}\\
x_{i}\mu_{i} & x_{i}^{2}\mu
\end{array}\right],
\]
as can be seen from the calculations above. Thus the information matrix
is
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\mu_{i} & x_{i}\mu_{i}\\
x_{i}\mu_{i} & x_{i}^{2}\mu
\end{array}\right].
\]

\subsection*{(d)}
A saturated model fits as well as possible to every observation, so
that it has $p=n$. Since the maximum likelihood estimator of the
Poisson distribution is the mean, $\tilde{\mu}_{i}=Y_{i}$.

\subsection*{(e)}
The deviance is $2\log L_{s}-2\log L_{m}$, where $L_{s}$ is the
saturated model and $L_{m}$ is the model under consideration. Use
it to test hypotheses for nested models.

\subsection*{(f)}
Calculate 
\[
P(1[Y_{i}>0]=1\mid x_{i})=1-P(Y_{i}=0\mid x_{i})=1-e^{-\mu_{i}}.
\]
 Invert it with respect to $\pi_{i}$ to get
\[
\log(1-\pi_{i})=-\mu_{i}
\]
and continue to get
\[
\log(-\log(1-\pi_{i}))=\beta^{T}x_{i}.
\]
The link function is called the cloglog.

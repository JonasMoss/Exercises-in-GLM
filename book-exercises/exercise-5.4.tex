\section*{Exercise 5.4}
When equation (5.5) holds for $\beta_{0}$, $x_{i,j} = 1$ and we have $\sum_{i=1}^{n} n_{i}y_{i} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} n_{i}\pi_{i}$. By dividing $N = \sum_{i=1}^{n} n_{i}$ on both sides, we obtain $\overline{y} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{n} n_{i}y_{i} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{n} n_{i}\pi_{i} = \pi$. So, the estimated overall success probability equals overall sample proportion of successes.

This result doesn't hold for binary GLMs where the link function is not logistic link function.
